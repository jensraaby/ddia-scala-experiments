# Designing Data-Intensive Applications Scala Experiments

I'm having a go at implementing some simplistic algorithms from the DDIA book.

It's mainly an excuse to sketch some interesting ideas.
There's a benchmark module to check performance of key-value stores.
Hopefully I'll get round to adding property-based tests as well.
